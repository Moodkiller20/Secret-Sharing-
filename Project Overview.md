# Secret-Sharing
CS 492 Computer Security Final Project



**Two-man Job**

  The idea for this project derives from Shamir’s Secret Sharing chapter from CS 492 and US Air Force Instruction (AFI) 91-104. The Two-man job will illustrate Linear Secret Sharing where the reconstruction of the secret from the shares is a linear mapping, and the key will be distributed between two authorized users.
  This project will be a web-based implementation of US Air Force Instruction (AFI) 91-104. The idea is that two people are required and must agree to execute a task. US Air Force Instruction is designed to prevent the accidental or malicious launch of nuclear weapons by a single individual. 

**IMPLEMENTATION OVERVIEW**

  A python file to validate the keys, and implement Shamir’s secret sharing, then the task being executed after both users agree will be a web-based animation of a nuclear weapon lunch.
